# Maths Club Website
I've been working on my school's maths club website, and this is a fork for a redesign I'm working on. <br>
As of now, you can view the original site here (upstream): https://maths-club.github.io <br>
and the redesigned website here (this repo): https://garv-shah.github.io/maths-club-test/

### How the site works:
The website simply creates a Jekyll feed from the repo, which is stored in feed.xml. Unlike a "standard" Jekyll site, instead of just creating the site in Markdown or the like, it parses the XML file and displays the feed (inserted by loadFeed.js). The point of this repo is to change the aesthetic appeal and make the page more friendly. <br>
The page also utilises some nifty CSS along with local storage to have a pretty nice settings page, which lets you modify every element to your colour preference and save it. There are a couple presets to choose from, along with a light/dark mode switch. Neat!

### Note:
I've also used this project as a sort of template for some other projects, namely the blog page for The NOVA System (https://github.com/The-NOVA-System/blog). Documentation on the system is a lot more clear there, so feel free to take a look!
