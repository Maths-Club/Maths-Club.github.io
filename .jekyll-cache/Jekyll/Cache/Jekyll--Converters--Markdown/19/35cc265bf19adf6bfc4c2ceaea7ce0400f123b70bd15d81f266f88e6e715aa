<h1 id="the-jerry-mao-maths-club">The Jerry Mao Maths Club</h1>

<p>The Jerry Mao Maths Club was founded at Caulfield Grammar Wheelers Hill Campus in 2017 by Jerry Mao (hence the name). He started the Maths Club to share his love of Maths and problem solving with other students at CGS. If you are a student at our school, then you have no doubt already heard about Jerry‚Äôs legendary achievements. But you can also find out more about him here:<br />

<p>In 2019, Junhua Chen took over as Maths Club Leader, after being ‚Äútrained up‚Äù by Jerry the previous year. Having representing Australia in Informatics, Junhua brought his passion for combinatorics, game analysis, and all areas of maths into the problem sets he created for Maths Club. The students loved his understated manner, friendly sense of humour and down-to-earth teaching style. Junhua also built this website after graduating!</p>

<p>In 2021, the Maths Club leadership was taken over by Chenxiao (Kevin) Zhou, Jasmin Wang and Eric He. They have each brought their own personalities to Maths Club: Kevin with his love of Euclidean Geometry and ‚Äútough-love‚Äù teaching style, Eric with his Algorithmic skills and crystal clear explanations, and Jasmin with her creative problem solving approaches and ‚Äúbad girl‚Äù image.</p>

<p>Whether you are a Maths gun looking for more of a challenge, or just enjoy the simple pleasure of investigating and solving problems, Maths Club is for you. We hope you learn something, and most of all, have fun!</p>
