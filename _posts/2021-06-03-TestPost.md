  > Answer: 17   
  
  
  Let's use trial and error to see which numbers are factors of 51   
  
  It's odd so we only need to try odd numbers:   
     * 1 is a factor: $51 = 1 \times 51$   
     * 3 is a factor: $51 = 3 \times 17$   
     * 5 is not a factor   
     * 7 is not a factor   
     * 9 is not a factor   
     
  And $9^2$ is already larger than 51, so we don't need to try any more.   
  The largest prime factor we found was 17.
