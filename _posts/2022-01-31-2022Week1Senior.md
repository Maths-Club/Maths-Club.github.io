# Problem 1
It is known that $\sqrt{b}+c = \sqrt{10+2\sqrt{24}}$. If $b$ and $c$ are both integers, find the value of $(b+c)^2$.
<br>
# Problem 2
if $a+\frac{1}{b}=6, a^3+\frac{1}{b^3}=180$, find the value of $\frac{a}{b}$.
<br>
# Problem 3
Let the positive integer $N$ be given by $\sqrt{\sqrt{\sqrt{\sqrt{\sqrt{N}}}}}=2019$. <br>
Simplify as much as possible, the expression $\frac{\sqrt{N\sqrt{N\sqrt{N\sqrt{N\sqrt{N}}}}}}{N}$.
<br>
# Problem 4
The cancellation of the Wimbledon tournament has led to a world surplus of tennis balls, and Santa has decided to use them as stocking fillers. He comes down the chimney with $n$ identical tennis balls, and he finds $k$ named stockings waiting for him. Let $g(n, k)$ be the number of ways that Santa can put the $n$ balls into the $k$ stockings; for example, $g(2, 2) = 3$, because with two balls and two children, Miriam and Adam, he can give both balls to Miriam, or both to Adam, or he can give them one ball each.
<br>
What is the value of $g(7, 5)$?
