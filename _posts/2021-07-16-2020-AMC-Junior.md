# Madeleine's PIN

Madeleine types her three-digit Personal Identification Number (PIN) into this keypad.
All three digits are different, but the buttons for the first and second digits share an edge, and the buttons for the second and third digits share an edge.
For instance, 563 is a possible PIN, but 536 is not, since 5 and 3 do not share an edge.
How many possibilities are there for Madeleineâ€™s PIN?

# Augusta's Cube

Starting with a $9\times9\times9$ cube, Augusta removed as few $1\times1\times1$ cubes as possible so that the resulting sculpture had front view, top view and side view all the same, as shown.
How many $1\times1\times1$ cubes did Augusta remove?

 <blockquote> Answer: 329</blockquote>   
  
 <p>
  The only cubes that Augusta has to remove are those that are in one of the 9 holes in at least one of the 3 views.
 </p>
  
 <p>
  Consider first making the central $3\times3$ hole from each direction. Each such hole can be considered as three $3\times3\times3$ cubes, but the three directions have a central $3\times3\times3$ cube in common. Consequently $7\times3^3=7\times27=189$ unit cubes are removed to make these holes, and $20\times33=540$ cubes are left.
 </p>
  
 <p>
  Now consider the $1\times1$ holes from each direction. Each of the twenty $3\times3\times3$ cubes remaining will have $7$ unit cubes removed, so $20\times7=140$ unit cubes in all.
  In total, Augusta removes $189 + 140=329$ unit cubes
